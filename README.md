# NBAPredictionModel

This is an NBA Prediction model which currently only predicts VORP (Value Over Replacement Player), an advanced metric that indicates how valuable a player is to a team. This stat has a high correlation with how well the player does in MVP rankings, and typically MVP winners have one of the best VORP stats among the entire league.

I plan on expanding on this model in the future to predict other stats and hopefully the actual future MVPs.
